        <img src="" /> 
        <p>JavaScript is one of the world’s most popular programming languages with over twenty years of history. It’s also one of the three main languages for web developers:
            HTML: Lets you add content to a web page.
            CSS: Specifies the layout, style, alignment of web pages.
            JavaScript: Improves the way web pages behave.
            JavaScript can be learned quickly and easily and used for a wide variety of purposes, from simply enhancing the functionality of a website to running games and web-based software. Better still, there are thousands of JavaScript templates and applications available for free thanks to sites like Github.
