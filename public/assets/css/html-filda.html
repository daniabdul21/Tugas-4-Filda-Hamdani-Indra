        <h2>What Is HTML?</h2>
        <img src="" /> 
        <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.

            HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
            
            When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and attributes) to mark up a website page. For example, we can create a paragraph by placing the enclosed text within a starting <p> and closing </p> tag.
            Overall, HTML is a markup language that is really straightforward and easy to learn even for complete beginners in website building. Here’s what you’ll learn by reading this article.

        <h2>What Is CSS?</h2>
        <img src="" /> 
        <p>CSS is what’s called a Cascading Style Sheet language, and is used to stylize elements written in a markup language such as HTML. It separates the content from the visual representation of the site.
            CSS was developed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996, for a rather simple reason. HTML was not designed to have tags that would help format the page. You were only supposed to write the markup for the site.
            Tags like <font> were introduced in HTML version 3.2, and it caused quite a lot of troubles for developers. Since websites had different fonts, colored backgrounds, and styles, it was a long, painful, and expensive process to rewrite the code. Thus, CSS was created by W3C to solve this problem.
            The relation between HTML and CSS is strongly tied together. Since HTML is a markup language (the very foundation of a site) and CSS emphasizes style (all of the aesthetics of a website), they go hand in hand together.
            CSS is not technically a necessity, but you probably wouldn’t want to look at a site that features only HTML as it would look completely bare-boned.

        <h2>What Is JavaScript?</h2>
        <img src="" /> 
        <p>JavaScript is one of the world’s most popular programming languages with over twenty years of history. It’s also one of the three main languages for web developers:
            HTML: Lets you add content to a web page.
            CSS: Specifies the layout, style, alignment of web pages.
            JavaScript: Improves the way web pages behave.
            JavaScript can be learned quickly and easily and used for a wide variety of purposes, from simply enhancing the functionality of a website to running games and web-based software. Better still, there are thousands of JavaScript templates and applications available for free thanks to sites like Github.
